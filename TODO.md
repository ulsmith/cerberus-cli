# TODO

* add in express support to run as a standalone stack with child forked processing.
* add in openfaas support
* document the cli
* find a way to make azure work from a single file, it uses a json file for each function which causes issues with a full route. maybe we dev in a single function and then build out and scale. or symlink to MVC
